<h4 id="1-What-are-benefits-of-using-HTTPS-over-HTTP"><a href="#1-What-are-benefits-of-using-HTTPS-over-HTTP" class="headerlink" title="1: What are benefits of using HTTPS over HTTP?"></a>1: What are benefits of using HTTPS over HTTP?</h4><p>HTTPS means that you <strong>tunnel the HTTP protocol over TLS&#x2F;SSL</strong> which encrypts the HTTP payload.</p>
<p>So the benefit is that HTTP requests and responses are transmitted securely over the wire, e.g. your Internet Service Provider does not know what you’re doing.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/548042">When Google switched Gmail to use HTTPS</a>, no additional resources were required; no network hardware, no new hosts. It only increased CPU load by about 1%.</p>
<h4 id="2-How-to-use-HTTPS"><a href="#2-How-to-use-HTTPS" class="headerlink" title="2: How to use HTTPS?"></a>2: How to use HTTPS?</h4><p>Enable it at your endpoint, in general <strong>a web server in front of your application server</strong>. Most web servers (e.g. IIS, Apache) support this by configuration. Depending on your confidentiality requirements this may not be enough.</p>
<h4 id="3-Can-we-use-HTTPS-for-only-login-purpose-and-then-onwords-HTTP"><a href="#3-Can-we-use-HTTPS-for-only-login-purpose-and-then-onwords-HTTP" class="headerlink" title="3: Can we use HTTPS for only login purpose and then onwords HTTP?"></a>3: Can we use HTTPS for only login purpose and then onwords HTTP?</h4><p>Technically this is possible, but it introduces some security risks. Example: After a secured login you transmit session IDs identifying the user. If you transmit those session IDs unsecurely (no SSL), session hijacking becomes a risk (‘man-in-the-middle’)</p>
<h4 id="4-What-settings-needs-to-be-done-for-making-website-HTTPS"><a href="#4-What-settings-needs-to-be-done-for-making-website-HTTPS" class="headerlink" title="4: What settings needs to be done for making website HTTPS?"></a>4: What settings needs to be done for making website HTTPS?</h4><p>See #2. In public internet scenarios you should request (buy) a certificate from a certain Certificate Authority (CA), so that end user clients can verify whether they should trust your certificate.</p>
<h4 id="5-Is-there-any-threat-present-in-HTTPS"><a href="#5-Is-there-any-threat-present-in-HTTPS" class="headerlink" title="5: Is there any threat present in HTTPS?"></a>5: Is there any threat present in HTTPS?</h4><p>In the protocol itself there is a slight risk of <strong>man-in-the-middle attacks</strong>. E.g. a proxy between the client and server could pretend to be the server itself (this requires a successful attack to network infrastructure, e.g. DNS). There are several other ‘more obscure’ risks that do not relate to the protocol itself, e.g.:</p>
<ol>
<li>usage of an outdated encryption key length (e.g. 256 bit)</li>
<li>loss of private keys or unappropriate key management procedures (e.g. send via unencrypted email)</li>
<li>certificate authority failure</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="6-Is-processing-time-required-for-HTTPS-is-greater-than-HTTP"><a href="#6-Is-processing-time-required-for-HTTPS-is-greater-than-HTTP" class="headerlink" title="6: Is processing time required for HTTPS is greater than HTTP?"></a>6: Is processing time required for HTTPS is greater than HTTP?</h4><p>Yes, key negotiation (handshaking) <strong>requires a lot CPU capacity</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/http-vs-https.png"></p>
<h3 id="Port-Number"><a href="#Port-Number" class="headerlink" title="Port Number"></a>Port Number</h3><p>HTTP uses <strong>port 80 or 8080</strong>, while HTTPS uses <strong>TCP port 443</strong>.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.coderanch.com/t/168608/java-Web-Component-SCWCD/certification/Diff">The reason</a> that some applications use 8080 (7080, 9080) instead of 80 is that on UNIX, <strong>port numbers below 1024</strong> are reserved for <strong>super-user</strong> processes.</p>
<p>That’s why for OS compatibility reasons, some servers use other ports (greater than 1024). But they still have “80” inside the numner, eg. 7080, 8080, 9080.</p>
