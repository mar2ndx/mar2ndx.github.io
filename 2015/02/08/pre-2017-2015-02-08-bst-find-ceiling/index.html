<blockquote>
<p>A binary search tree is given. Find the ceiling of given key. Eg.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>                    8
               3          12
           2      6    10    15
                4
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Ceiling is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/floor-and-ceil-from-a-bst/">defined</a> as:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ceil Value Node: Node with smallest data larger than the key value.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Testing:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>key - 13 =&gt; 15
key - 4 =&gt;6
key - 8 =&gt;10
</code></pre>
<h3 id="Solution"><a href="#Solution" class="headerlink" title="Solution"></a>Solution</h3><p><strong>A really interesting idea</strong> is to go top-to-bottom, and update value in every <strong>left turn only</strong>. Suggested by the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.careercup.com/question?id=20229674">top answer</a>.</p>
<p>It’s a very very tricky solution. I’ve never seen this b4.</p>
<h3 id="Code"><a href="#Code" class="headerlink" title="Code"></a>Code</h3><p>Not my code.</p>
<pre><code>public int findCeil(TreeNode node, int num, int found) &#123;
	if (node != null) &#123;
		if (num &gt;= node.val)
			return findCeil(node.right, num, found);
		else
			return findCeil(node.left, num, node.val);
	&#125; else
		return found;
&#125;
</code></pre>
<p>Now input:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TreeNode tree &#x3D; Common.constructBstFromPreorder(new int[] { 40, 20, 10, 30, 60, 50, 70 });</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Output:</p>
