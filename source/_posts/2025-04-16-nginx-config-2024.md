# Configure Nginx in 2024

First, read the old blog post that I wrote 10 years ago: https://mar2ndx.github.io/2015/04/30/unclemartian-nginx-tutorial/index.html

## Config on CentOS 7

```bash
systemctl status nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

### 1. nginx.conf 必备配置

```bash
sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

Look out for the 2 lines of `include`, and the `server` block. Those are the only important parts.

```
    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
    include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;

    server {
        listen       80;
        listen       [::]:80;
        server_name  _;
        root         /usr/share/nginx/html;

        # Load configuration files for the default server block.
        include /etc/nginx/default.d/*.conf;

        error_page 404 /404.html;
        location = /404.html {
        }

        error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
        }
    }
```

1. Currently, my `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` is empty.
2. Put a config for each website under `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`, which contains symlinks to `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`.
3. `listen 80` is for http, and `listen [::]:80` is for IPv6 http.
4. `server_name _` means match all hosts. This is the fallback server, in case no other server matches.

## 2. sites-available 文件夹

Now let's look at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`. Please note that the `.conf` extension is just for convention, not required.

`resilio.conf`:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name resilio.website.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8888;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

`metaagent.conf`:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name metaagent.website.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://<your_server_ip>:3459;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

## 3. sites-enabled 文件夹

This is the list of websites that are enabled:

```
ls -l /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

To symlink:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/some_config.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/some_config.conf
```

Test that it works:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

## Debugging 遇到问题

If error, check:

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
```

Or just

```
cat /var/log/nginx/error.log
cat /var/log/nginx/access.log
```

For example, I found the error in `error.log`:

```
2024/11/27 03:14:27 [crit] 24614#24614: *15 connect() to xxx failed (13: Permission denied) while connecting to upstream, client: 162.158.106.217, server: xxxxx.345321.xyz, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", upstream: "xxxxxxx", host: "xxxxxxx"
```

This is due to SELinux, a Linxu security module that blocks Nginx from connecting to my python server.

To fix, run:

```bash
sudo setenforce 0
sudo setenforce 1
sudo setsebool httpd_can_network_connect on -P
```

Or this error:

```
connect() failed (111: Connection refused) suggests that when Nginx tries to access the Resilio Sync service at http://142.171.174.241:8888, it's unable to establish a connection
```

This is most likely due to Resilio not allowing access from `0.0.0.0`, or it's re-directing to https instead of http.
