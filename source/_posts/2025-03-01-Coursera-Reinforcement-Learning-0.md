Difference:

* Supervised learning - access labeled examples with given answers. 
* UnSupervised learning - extract underlying structure in data, it's about data representation. 
* Reinforced learning - The reward give the agent some idea of good/bad in its recent actions. 

RL focus on the problem of learning while interacting with an ever-changing world.
