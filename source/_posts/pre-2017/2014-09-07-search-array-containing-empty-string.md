### Question

> Given a sorted array of strings which is interspersed with empty strings, write a method to find the location of a given string.

> Example: find “ball” in [“at”, “”, “”, “”, “ball”, “”, “”, “car”, “”, “”, “dad”, “”, “”] will return 4

> Example: find “ballcar” in [“at”, “”, “”, “”, “”, “ball”, “car”, “”, “”, “dad”, “”, “”] will return -1

### Solution

The solution is binary search, but when reads empty, **advance to the next non-empty string**.

But wait, **there can be a very big problem that causes looping forever**. Eg.

> "a", "", "", "", "c" (5 items), look for "b"

> Now 'left' points to 1st string("a") and 'right' points to 4th(""). If we read read 'mid' value and advance to the next non-empty string, it'll be "c".

> since "c" is large than "b", 'right' is set to the 4th index. It's a endless loop!

There're various ways to solve this. The book suggests **locate 'right' pointer at non-empty string** by moving left, and then **locate 'mid' pointer at non-empty** by moving right. This avoids endless loop.

My approach is to use 2 instances of 'mid':

1. calculatedMid
1. comparisonMid

Both ways are fine.

### Code

    public static int search(String[] input, String target) {
    	if (target == null || target.length() == 0) {
    		return -1;
    	}
    	int len = input.length;
    	int left = 0, right = len - 1;
    	while (left < right) {
    		int calculatedMid = left + (right - left) / 2;
    		int comparisonMid = calculatedMid;
    		while (comparisonMid < len && input[comparisonMid].length() == 0) {
    			comparisonMid++;
    		}
    		if (input[comparisonMid].equals(target)) {
    			return comparisonMid;
    		} else if (input[comparisonMid].compareTo(target) < 0) {
    			left = comparisonMid + 1;
    		} else {
    			right = calculatedMid - 1;
    		}
    	}
    	if (left < len && input[left].equals(target)) {
    		return left;
    	} else {
    		return -1;
    	}
    }
