# A short answer

In Java, all classes must have a constructor.

## Can abstract class have constructor

[Yes, it can](http://www.mitbbs.com/article_t/JobHunting/32257933.html). However, if we create an instance using it, it's error.

Consider [this example](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/abstract-classes-in-java/):

    abstract class Base {
        Base() { System.out.println("Base Constructor Called"); }
        abstract void fun();
    }

    class Derived extends Base {
        Derived() { System.out.println("Derived Constructor Called"); }
        void fun() { System.out.println("Derived fun() called"); }
    }

    class Main {
        public static void main(String args[]) {
           Derived d = new Derived();
        }
    }

Output:

    Base Constructor Called
    Derived Constructor Called

## More info on constructor:

The [constructor in an abstract class](http://stackoverflow.com/a/261159):

1. is used when you want to perform some initialization
1. you may define more than one constructor (with different arguments)
1. if you don't define a constructor, then the compiler will automatically generate one for you.
1. your subclass constructor **have to call a constructor** from the abstract class
1. you can define all your constructors protected (cuz making them public is pointless)

For more on abstract class, read **[Java OOP] Template method pattern**.
