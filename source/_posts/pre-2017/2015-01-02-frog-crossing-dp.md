### Question

[link](https://tkramesh.wordpress.com/2011/02/15/frog-crossing-more-on-dynamic-programming-3/)

> A frog wants to cross the river n meters wide. There're some stones, but not complete from 1 to n.

> The frog has a peculiar jumping rule. If it jumps x meters on one jump, the next jump has to lie in the range {x-1, x, x+1}. Further, the 1st jump that the frog makes is of exactly 1 meter.

> Given whether stones are removed or not as array of 0 and 1, check if it is possible to reach the other end.

### Solution

**This is a difficult DP question**. It can be solved in O(n^2) time.

The main equation is:

> can_reach [s, d] =
>
> Stone[d] AND Stone[s] AND [ can_reach [(d-s)-1, s] OR can_reach[d-s, s] OR can_reach[d-s)+1, s] ].
>
> where 's' is starting point, and 'd' is destination.

### Code

    public boolean canCross(int[] stones) {
    	if (stones.length < 2 || (stones[0] != 1 || stones[1] != 1)) {
    		// invalid input data
    		return false;
    	}
    	int n = stones.length;
    	boolean[][] dp = new boolean[n][n];
    	// dp[i][j] denotes that frog can jump from index i to j

    	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    		for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
    			if (stones[i] == 0 || stones[j] == 0) {
    				// if either stones i or stone j is removed, skip
    				continue;
    			}
    			// note that j start from (i+1) because we make sure dp[i][i]
    			// false. Otherwise, dp[i][i+1] will always be true

    			if (i == 0) {
    				// if jump from position 0, can only reach 1
    				dp[i][j] = j == 1;
    			} else {
    				// if jump from other positions, need to check previous
    				// distance, within range or not.
    				int dis = j - i;
    				for (int pre = i - dis - 1; pre <= i - dis + 1; pre++) {
    					// pre is the previous position where frog jumps to i
    					if (pre < 0) {
    						continue;
    					} else if (dp[pre][i]) {
    						// frog jumps from pre to i, then frog is able to
    						// jump from i to j
    						dp[i][j] = true;
    						break;
    					}
    				}
    			}
    			// finish calculating dp[i][j], now check termination
    			if (j == n - 1 && dp[i][j]) {
    				return true;
    			}
    		}
    	}
    	return false;
    }
