### Question

[link](http://www.careercup.com/question?id=5979667)

> How to serialize strings and pass it over the network and de-serialize the string?

> The string may contain **any possible character** out of 256 valid characters.

### Solution

The difficulty is how to **differentiate between data (string) and metadata**. Some interesting ideas:

1. XML
2. message with header + body

The best is the [top answer](http://www.careercup.com/question?id=5979667):

> I think that a good answer is to send the length of the string in bytes (coded for example as a 4 bytes unsigned integer) followed by the list of bytes, one per char.

> The receiver reads the first 4 bytes and understand the string length (let says L), then it reads the following L bytes and build the string.

### Code

eg. 5hello 5world 2my 4name 2is
