### Question

[link](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/recover-binary-search-tree/)

<div class="question-content">
            <p></p><p>
Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.</p>

<p>Recover the tree without changing its structure.
</p>

<b>Note:</b><br>
A solution using O(<i>n</i>) space is pretty straight forward. Could you devise a constant space solution?

### Analysis

**This is one of the most difficult questions that I have solved**.

The question can be solved using 2 pointers to point to the 2 misplaced nodes, and swap them. I solved the problem with this approach, and I found a good explanation [here](http://chaoren.is-programmer.com/posts/42931.html).

> Only two variables (first, second) are enough to record nodes to be exchanged.
>
> If there's only one descending order pair (e.g. 20, 10, 30, 40, 50), use first & second to record it.
>
> If there are two descending order pairs (e.g. 10, 40, 30, 20, 50 or 50, 20, 30, 40, 10), use the smaller number in second pair to update variable 'second'.
>
> In the end, swap first and second.

This is a popular solution on the Internet, which **uses O(1) space, plus average case O(lgn) stack space** (because recursion always incur stack usage). So this solution is actually not fulfilling the requirements.

> 中序遍历二叉树的空间复杂度是 O(logN) on average case

**So finally I found a solution with constent space, and it's using Treaded Binary Tree again**! Look below for details.

### Solution

[This](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inorder-tree-traversal-without-recursion-and-without-stack/) is a systematic analysis of **Morris Traversal** based on **Threaded Binary Tree**.

**A solution of using Morris Traversal is explained [here](http://www.cnblogs.com/TenosDoIt/p/3445682.html)**. Don't worry about the tree structure being changed, because it's reverted back after the traversal.

> 算法 2：为了满足 O(1)空间复杂度，我们就要使用非递归且不使用栈的中序遍历算法，在 leetcode 另一个题目 Binary Tree Inorder Traversal 中，我们提到了 Morris Traversal 中序遍历算法，它既没有递归，也没有使用栈，而是用了线索二叉树的思想，用闲置的右节点指向中序序列中该节点的后缀，遍历后再恢复树的原始指针。其主要算法步骤如下：

**[Another person](http://fisherlei.blogspot.sg/2012/12/leetcode-recover-binary-search-tree.html)** have a very good (maybe better) English version of analysis and code:

    1. Initialize current as root
    2. While current is not NULL
       If current does not have left child
          a) Print current’s data
          b) Go to the right, i.e., current = current-&gt;right
       Else
          a) Make current as right child of the rightmost node in current's left subtree
          b) Go to this left child, i.e., current = current-&gt;left

### Code

**First, my code (2 pointer solution)**

    TreeNode first = null, second = null;
    TreeNode pre = new TreeNode(Integer.MIN_VALUE);

    public void recoverTree(TreeNode root) {
        helper(root);
        // now first and second are both found
        int temp = first.val;
        first.val = second.val;
        second.val = temp;
    }

    private void helper(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return;
        helper(root.left);
        if (pre.val > root.val) {
            if (first == null) {
                first = pre;
                second = root;
            }
            else second = root;
        }
        pre = root;
        helper(root.right);
    }

**Second, real O(1) space solution** using Threaded Binary Tree (i.e. Morris Traversal) in C++. I could not memorize this code.

    void recoverTree(TreeNode *root) {
           TreeNode *f1=NULL, *f2=NULL;
           TreeNode  *current,*pre, *parent=NULL;

           if(root == NULL)
                 return;
           bool found = false;
           current = root;
           while(current != NULL)
           {
                 if(current->left == NULL)
                 {
                        if(parent && parent->val > current->val)
                        {
                               if(!found)
                               {
                                     f1 = parent;
                                     found = true;
                               }
                               f2 = current;
                        }
                        parent = current;
                        current = current->right;
                 }
                 else
                 {
                        /* Find the inorder predecessor of current */
                        pre = current->left;
                        while(pre->right != NULL && pre->right != current)
                               pre = pre->right;

                        /* Make current as right child of its inorder predecessor */
                        if(pre->right == NULL)
                        {
                               pre->right = current;
                               current = current->left;
                        }

                        /* Revert the changes made in if part to restore the original
                        tree i.e., fix the right child of predecssor */
                        else
                        {
                               pre->right = NULL;
                               if(parent->val > current->val)
                               {
                                     if(!found)
                                     {
                                            f1 = parent;
                                            found = true;
                                     }
                                     f2 = current;
                               }
                               parent = current;
                               current = current->right;
                        } /* End of if condition pre->right == NULL */
                 } /* End of if condition current->left == NULL*/
           } /* End of while */

           if(f1 && f2)
                 swap(f1->val, f2->val);
    }
