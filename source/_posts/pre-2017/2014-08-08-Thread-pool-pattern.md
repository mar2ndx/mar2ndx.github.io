### Overview

[Thread pool](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/173580) is a collection of managed threads usually organized in a queue, which execute the tasks in the task queue.

Thread pool is a group of pre-instantiated, idle threads which stand ready to be given work.

### Why Thread Pool?

**Thread Pools are useful when you need to limit the number of threads** running in your application at the same time.

Thread pools are often used in multi threaded servers. Each connection **arriving at the server via the network is wrapped as a task** and passed on to a thread pool. The threads in the thread pool will process the requests on the connections concurrently.

> [Many server applications](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-jtp0730/), such as **Web servers (eg. Tomcat)**, database servers, file servers, or mail servers must process a large number of tasks received from a network protocol. Often, the task is short-lived and the number of requests is large.

> Instead of starting a new thread for every task to execute concurrently, the **task can be passed to a thread pool**. As soon as the pool has any idle threads the task is assigned to one of them and executed.

### Implementation

This is a [simple thread pool implementation](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/thread-pools.html). The pool is implemented using a list of tasks, and a list of threads. Theads will fetch tasks and run it. The list is implemented with a BlockingQueue - however, it's fine to use just a normal queue.

Main Class:

    public class Main {

        public static void main(String[] args) {

            // In this example, we create 3 thread to run 10 tasks
            // set the BlockingQ size to be 5.

            ThreadPool tp = new ThreadPool(3, 5);

            List<MyTask> todoList = new ArrayList<MyTask>();
            for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
                todoList.add(new MyTask("T" + i));
            }

            for (MyTask todo : todoList) {
                tp.execute(todo);
            }

            while (!tp.noMoreTask()) {
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(2000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
            tp.stop();
        }

    }

Pool Class:

    public class ThreadPool {

        // a list of tasks (BlockingQueue)
        // a list of thread
        private MyBlockingQueue taskQueue = null;
        private List<MyThread> threads = new ArrayList<MyThread>();
        private boolean isStopped = false;

        public ThreadPool(int numThreads, int maxNumTasks) {
            taskQueue = new MyBlockingQueue(maxNumTasks);

            for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; i++) {
                threads.add(new MyThread(taskQueue));
            }
            System.out.println("Thread pool initiated. ");
            for (MyThread thread : threads) {
                thread.start();
            }
        }

        public synchronized void execute(Runnable task) {
            if (this.isStopped) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("ThreadPool is stopped");
            }

            try {
                this.taskQueue.enqueue(task);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }

        public boolean noMoreTask() {
            return this.taskQueue.isEmpty();
        }

        public synchronized void stop() {
            this.isStopped = true;
            for (MyThread thread : threads) {
    //			thread.stop();
                thread.interrupt();
            }
            System.out.println("Thread pool stopped. ");
        }
    }

Thread Class:

    public class MyThread extends Thread {

        private MyBlockingQueue taskQueue = null;
        private boolean isStopped = false;

        public MyThread(MyBlockingQueue queue) {
            taskQueue = queue;
        }

        public void run() {
            while (!isStopped()) {
                try {
                    Runnable runnable = (Runnable) taskQueue.dequeue();
                    runnable.run();
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    // log or otherwise report exception,
                    // but keep pool thread alive.
                }
            }
        }

        // public synchronized void stop() {
        // isStopped = true;
        // this.interrupt(); // break pool thread out of dequeue() call.
        // }

        public synchronized boolean isStopped() {
            return isStopped;
        }
    }

Task Class:

    public class MyTask implements Runnable {

        String message;

        public MyTask(String s) {
            message = s;
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            // do some task here...
            // finish the task ...
            System.out.println("Task finished: " + message);
        }
    }

Output:

    Thread pool initiated.
    Task finished: T1
    Task finished: T3
    Task finished: T4
    Task finished: T5
    Task finished: T6
    Task finished: T2
    Task finished: T7
    Task finished: T10
    Task finished: T9
    Task finished: T8
    Thread pool stopped.
