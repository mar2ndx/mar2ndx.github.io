### Question

[link](http://www.careercup.com/question?id=5931067269709824)

> Given a string, find if there is any sub-sequence that repeats itself. Do not reuse any char.

> Eg:

    1. abab <------yes, ab is repeated
    2. abba <---- No, a and b follow different order
    3. acbdaghfb <-------- yes, a followed by b twice
    4. abcdacb <----- yes, a followed by b twice

> Note that no char should be reused. I.e. "aab" is a false.

### Solution

This looks like a question without any clue. However, this actually is a modified version of **[LintCode] Longest Common Subsequence**.

Look at that question: there's 2 input string, and they match char-by-char. For this question, we are simply **matching input string with input string itself**. And chars should be match **ONLY** at different positions, that's the key. As pointed out by the [top comment](http://www.careercup.com/question?id=5931067269709824):

> Now we can modify the longest_common_subsequence(a, a) to find the value of the longest repeated subsequence in a by excluding the cases when i == j

### Code

    public boolean checkRepeatSubseq(String input) {
    	int len = input.length();
    	int[][] dp = new int[len + 1][len + 1];
    	// dp[i][j] denotes the length of subseq between 2 strings:
    	// 1. first i chars of input
    	// 2. first j chars of input
    	for (int i = 1; i <= len; i++) {
    		for (int j = i; j <= len; j++) {
    			if (i != j && input.charAt(i - 1) == input.charAt(j - 1)) {
    				int temp = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
    				dp[i][j] = Math.max(temp, dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1);
    			} else {
    				dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
    			}
    		}
    	}
    	return dp[len][len] >= 2;
    }
