### Question

[link](http://oj.leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)

<div class="question-content">
<p></p><p>Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.</p>

<div class="spoilers" style="display: block;"><b>Some hints:</b>

<p>Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)</p>

<p>If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.</p>

<p>You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?</p>

<p>There is a more generic way of solving this problem.</p>

### Analysis

This question is easy, and very similar to the "Reverse Integer" question. **Simpliest solution is to just reverse the integer** and compare with original number.

But again, reversing the integer have chances of **overflow**. How do we work this out?

### Solution

First, same as previous post **[LeetCode 7] Reverse Integer**, we can use Long type to handle the overflow issues.

Second, **we can also do direct compare** to always compare the head and tail of the number. No numerical type conversion is needed. I came up with idea previously, and code is posted below.

### My code

Use Long type:

    public class Solution {
        public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
            if (x < 0) {
                return false;
            }
            long rev = 0;
            long original = x;
            while (x != 0) {
                rev = rev * 10 + (x % 10);
                x = x / 10;
            }
            return original == rev;
        }
    }

Compare head and tail:

    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        if (x < 0) {
            return false;
        }
        int divide = 1;
        while (x / divide >= 10) {
            divide *= 10;
        }
        int head = 0, tail = 0;
        while (divide > 0) {
            head = x / divide;
            tail = x % 10;
            if (head != tail) {
                return false;
            }
            x = x % divide / 10;
            divide /= 100;
        }
        return true;
    }
