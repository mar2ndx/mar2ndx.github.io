# Overview

O(n) time complexity is both __reflexive, symmetric and transitive__.

## Reflexive Property

The Reflexive Property states that for every real number x, x = x.

## Symmetric Property

The Symmetric Property states that for all real numbers x and y,

if x = y, then y = x.

## Transitive Property

The Transitive Property states that for all real numbers x, y, and z,

if x = y and y = z, then x = z.
