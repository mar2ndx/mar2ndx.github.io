### Question

> In Java, does the finally block gets executed if we insert a return statement inside the try block of a try-catch-finally?

### Solution

Yes, it will.

Even when we attempt to exit within the try block (normal exit, return, continue, break or any exception), **the finally block will still be executed**.

The only time finally [won't be called](http://stackoverflow.com/a/65049) is if you call System.exit() or if the JVM crashes first.
