### Question

[link](http://oj.leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

<div class="question-content">
            <p></p><p>
Given <i>n</i> non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining. 
</p>

<p>
For example, <br>
Given <code>[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]</code>, return <code>6</code>.
</p>

<p>

</p><p style="font-size: 11px">The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. <b>Thanks Marcos</b> for contributing this image!</p><p></p>

### Solution

**This is an interesting question**.

**Most popular solution is DP**. The explanation from [this blog](http://rleetcode.blogspot.sg/2014/03/trapping-rain-water-java-python.html) is slightly confusing, so I will explain it here. **Basic idea is to do 2 iteration**. First time get the heighest bound to the left of every point. Second time get the heighest bound to the right.

> Example: input = \[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1\].

> Assume the 2 DP arrays are called highestLeftSoFar and highestRightSoFar.

> highestLeftSoFar = 0,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3

> highestRightSoFar = 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,1

> For each point, get the lowest bound (of the 2 bounds), and calculate water.

**There is another solution** making use of stack from [this blog](http://n00tc0d3r.blogspot.sg/2013/06/trapping-rain-water.html). This idea is IMHO not very good.

1. Use Stack to store the index of a bar;
2. If the current one is smaller then the top of the stack, push it to stack;
3. Otherwise, pop up the top until stack is empty or top is greater than the current one, add up the volume, push the current one to stack.

> The tricky part is what is the volume to be added each time when we pop up a value from the stack.

### My code

    public class Solution {
        public int trap(int[] A) {
            if (A == null || A.length <= 1) {
                return 0;
            }
            int len = A.length;
            int[] leftBound = new int[len];
            for (int i = 1; i < len; i++) {
                leftBound[i] = Math.max(leftBound[i - 1], A[i - 1]);
            }
            int rightBound = 0;
            int water = 0;
            for (int i = len - 2; i > 0; i--) {
                rightBound = Math.max(rightBound, A[i + 1]);
                int contains = Math.min(leftBound[i], rightBound);
                // important to note, that contains can be 0!
                water += Math.max(0, contains - A[i]);
            }
            return water;
        }
    }

Stack Solution.

    public int trap(int[] A) {
        int cur = 0;
        while (cur < A.length && A[cur] == 0) cur ++;
        int vol = 0;
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();
        while (cur < A.length) {
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && A[cur] >= A[stack.peek()]) {
                int b = stack.pop();
                if (stack.isEmpty()) break;
                vol += ((cur - stack.peek() - 1) * (Math.min(A[cur], A[stack.peek()]) - A[b]));
            }
            stack.push(cur ++);
            cur ++;
        }
        return vol;
    }

**updated on Aug 27th, 2014**, there is a very very good 2 pointer solution which reads the input only **once**!

[This post](http://qandwhat.runkite.com/i-failed-a-twitter-interview/) wrote about it, and [source code](https://gist.github.com/mkozakov/59af0fd5bddbed1a0399) available.

    public int trap(int[] A) {
        if (A == null || A.length == 0) {
    		return 0;
    	}

    	int len = A.length;
    	int left = 0;
    	int right = len - 1;
    	int leftHeight = 0;
    	int rightHeight = 0;
    	int water = 0;

    	while (left < right) {
    		leftHeight = Math.max(leftHeight, A[left]);
    		rightHeight = Math.max(rightHeight, A[right]);
    		// Two ways to write the following if-condition
    		// This would also work: if (A[left] < A[right]) {
    		if (leftHeight < rightHeight) {
    			// increase left pointer
    			water += leftHeight - A[left];
    			left++;
    		} else {
    			water += rightHeight - A[right];
    			right--;
    		}
    	}
    	return water;
    }
