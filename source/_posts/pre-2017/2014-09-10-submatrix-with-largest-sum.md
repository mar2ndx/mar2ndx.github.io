### Question

> Given an NxN matrix of positive and negative integers, write code to find the sub-matrix with the largest possible sum.

### Solution

I wrote about this question before: **[Question] Max Sum In A 2D Array (sub-matrix)**, and the solution gave a better time complexity (O(n^3)) than in the book (O(n^4)).

1. locate a row - O(n)
1. locate another row - O(n)
1. compute sub value of that column - O(n), and then find largest subarray in array - also O(n)
1. The above 3 steps each take O(n) time, total time is O(n^3).

Please refer to the other post for more detail.
