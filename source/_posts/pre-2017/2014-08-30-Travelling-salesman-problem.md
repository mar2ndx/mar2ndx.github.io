### TSP problem

[Given a list of cities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?

It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization. We will discuss 2 category of solutions:

1. Exact algorithms
1. Heuristic and approximation algorithms

### Exact algorithms

1. **Brute force search**, which the run time is O(n!), which is impossible for 20 cities.

1. **DP** Held–Karp algorithm. O(n^2 x 2^n).

1. **Branch-and-bound** algorithm. This can process 40-60 cities.

### Heuristic and approximation algorithms

1. **Greedy**, or Nearest Neighbour algorithm. (an improved version is called Nearest Fragment algorithm, which connect NN in groups)

1. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**, build the [MST](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree) using [Kruskal's algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal's_algorithm) and then do a **Depth-first Tree Tour**. [link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWHZAtQl1vI) to video.

   1. Sort all edges from small to large, then add edges into MST as long as no cycle is created. In the end, a MST is achieved.

   1. Do Depth-first Tree Tour(DFTT)

   1. Length of DFTT is 2 x weight of MST.

   1. Skip some nodes that's only visited once.

   1. We get an legitimate solution.

### Iterative improvement

Now these are the solutions. However we can improve it by doing **2-opt Swap**.

It means selecting 2 edges at random. If swapping results in an improvement, then keep it. Keep doing this. [link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC5CX8drAtU) to video.
