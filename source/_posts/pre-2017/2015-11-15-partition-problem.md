# Question

[link](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-18-partition-problem/)

> [partition problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_problem) is the task of deciding whether a given multiset S of positive integers can be partitioned into two subsets S1 and S2 such that the sum of the numbers in S1 equals the sum of the numbers in S2.

> Examples

    arr[] = {1, 5, 11, 5}
    Output: true
    The array can be partitioned as {1, 5, 5} and {11}

    arr[] = {1, 5, 3}
    Output: false
    The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum sets.

# Solution

**DP** (only if sum of the elements is not too big).

> [We can create a 2D array](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-18-partition-problem/) of size (sum/2)\*(n+1). And we can construct the solution in bottom up manner such that every filled entry has following property:

    part[i][j] =
        true if a subset of {arr[0], arr[1], ..arr[j-1]} has sum equal to i
        false otherwise

Note that we always cares about **whether there exist a valid subset from beginning to index i**.

Example DP array for input "3,1,1,2,2,1":
