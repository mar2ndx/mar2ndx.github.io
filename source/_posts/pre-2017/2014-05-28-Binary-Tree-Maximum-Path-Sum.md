### Question

[link](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/)

<div class="question-content">
            <p></p><p>
Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.
</p>

<p>
The path may start and end at any node in the tree.
</p>

<p>
For example:<br>
Given the below binary tree,
</p><pre>       1
      / \
     2   3
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>
Return <code>6</code>.
</p><p></p>

### Analysis

**This is a difficult DFS question**.

The basic idea is:

> When we are in a root node, how we decided to include current node in the maximum path sum? We need to calculate the depth in both subtree. In the meantime, we need to set a variable "max" to store the max path sum we found during the recursion.

> Pay attention that when a subtree sum to negative value, we discard this subtree.

> Otherwise, max path sum including current node is **leftSum + cur.val + rightSum**

> Max depth of current node is **(maximum value of leftSum and rightSum) + cur.val**

### Solution

There are 2 points that may incur problems during coding, they are:

1. The recursive solution is calculating the 'max height' while checking 'its own max path sum'. It's a bit hard to explain. Basic idea is doing 2 things at same time, while traversing (are one result is returned, another is stored in a public variable, at least for code 1 below).

2. Note that 'max height' of a child branch can be nagative. In this case, WE MUST SET IT TO 0.

The first point is a concept seen in previous questions, but I forgot which. The second point is important, because I missed this and got failed a few times without any clue.

### Code

**First, recursive solution**

    int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        maxHeight(root);
        return max;
    }

    private int maxHeight(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return 0;
        int l = Math.max(0, maxHeight(node.left));
        int r = Math.max(0, maxHeight(node.right));
        max = Math.max(max, l + r + node.val);
        return node.val + Math.max(l, r);
    }

**Second, previous code refactored**.

I removed the global variable, and instead pass an array as reference in the recursion. In this way the 'shared' array achieve same functionality as a global variable.

    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        int[] shared = {Integer.MIN_VALUE};
        maxHeight(root, shared);
        return shared[0];
    }

    private int maxHeight(TreeNode node, int[] shared) {
        if (node == null) return 0;
        int l = Math.max(0, maxHeight(node.left, shared));
        int r = Math.max(0, maxHeight(node.right, shared));
        shared[0] = Math.max(shared[0], l + r + node.val);
        return node.val + Math.max(l, r);
    }

**Updated on June 10th, it's a terrible practise to use global variable**. The [new solution](http://answer.ninechapter.com/solutions/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/) suggested by Mr. Huang uses a new ResultType Class to solve the problem.

    private class ResultType {
        int singlePath, maxPath;
        ResultType(int singlePath, int maxPath) {
            this.singlePath = singlePath;
            this.maxPath = maxPath;
        }
    }

    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        ResultType result = helper(root);
        return result.maxPath;
    }

    private ResultType helper(TreeNode node) {
        // null case
        if (node == null) {
            return new ResultType(0, Integer.MIN_VALUE);
        }
        // divide
        ResultType ll = helper(node.left);
        ResultType rr = helper(node.right);
        // conquer
        int curSinglePath = Math.max(0, node.val +
                Math.max(ll.singlePath, rr.singlePath));
        int childMaxPath = Math.max(ll.maxPath, rr.maxPath);
        int curMaxPath = Math.max(childMaxPath, node.val +
                ll.singlePath + rr.singlePath);
        // done
        return new ResultType(curSinglePath, curMaxPath);
    }
