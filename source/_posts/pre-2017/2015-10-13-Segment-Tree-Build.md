### Question

[link](http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/segment-tree-build/)

> The structure of Segment Tree is a binary tree which each node has two attributes start and end denote an segment / interval.

> start and end are both integers, they should be assigned in following rules:

> The root's start and end is given by build method.
> The left child of node A has start=A.left, end=(A.left + A.right) / 2.
> The right child of node A has start=(A.left + A.right) / 2 + 1, end=A.right.
> if start equals to end, there will be no children for this node.

> Implement a build method with two parameters start and end, so that we can create a corresponding segment tree with every node has the correct start and end value, return the root of this segment tree.

### Solution

A simple top-down run through.

### Code

    /**
     * Definition of SegmentTreeNode:
     * public class SegmentTreeNode {
     *     public int start, end;
     *     public SegmentTreeNode left, right;
     *     public SegmentTreeNode(int start, int end) {
     *         this.start = start, this.end = end;
     *         this.left = this.right = null;
     *     }
     * }
     */
    public class Solution {
        /**
         *@param start, end: Denote an segment / interval
         *@return: The root of Segment Tree
         */
        public SegmentTreeNode build(int start, int end) {
            // write your code here
            if (start > end) {
                return null;
            }
            SegmentTreeNode node = new SegmentTreeNode(start, end);
            if (start < end) {
                node.left = build(start, (start + end) / 2);
                node.right = build((start + end) / 2 + 1, end);
            }
            return node;
        }
    }
