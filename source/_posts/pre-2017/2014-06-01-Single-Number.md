### Question

[link](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

<div class="question-content bg-color bg-img font-color">
            <p class="font-color"></p><p class="font-color">Given an array of integers, every element appears <i>twice</i> except for one. Find that single one.</p>

<p class="font-color">
<b>Note:</b><br>
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

### Analysis

**First solutions is bit manipulation**.

> If two numbers are the same, then XOR result is 0.

And for negative integers:

> A negative number is a [bit field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_field) just like a positive number. XOR doesn't care

Follow-up question, what if the input is not an array in interger, but a bunch of Strings? [This guy](http://stackoverflow.com/a/35271) have the answer.

> There are ways of XORing strings by XORing the individual chars - you would just have to have a temporary variable as large as the largest string.

> What wouldn't work is trying to XOR a linked list or some other complicated data structure.

Which is to say, a string is just like an array of chars (integers). For every char (integer), just apply the same method and we shall have the answer.

**Second solution is HashSet**, but must use more space. Code is posted below as well.

Someone also sort then find, but this takes more time.

### Code

**First, XOR solution**

    public int singleNumber(int[] A) {
        int num = A[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < A.length; i ++)
            num = num ^ A[i];
        return num;
    }

**Second, HashSet solution**

The last line "return -1" is only for compiling purposes, and will not be executed.

    public int singleNumber(int[] A) {
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<Integer>();
        for (int i = 0; i < A.length; i ++) {
            if (set.contains(A[i]))
                set.remove(A[i]);
            else
                set.add(A[i]);
        }
        for (Integer a: set)
            return a;
    	return -1;
    }
