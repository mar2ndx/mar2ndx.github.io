### Question

> You have two very large binary trees: T1, with millions of nodes, and T2, with hundreds of nodes. Create an algorithm to decide if T2 is a subtree of T1.

### Solution 1

**The best solution is to print inorder and preorder traversal** of both trees. Find whether the 2 traversal string of T2 **is substring of the traversal of T1**. This is a very good idea of checking subtree of a Binary Tree.

**Updated on Jan 26th, 2015**: do we have to use sentinals for this purpose? Well, the answer is NO, cuz a preorder and a inorder can uniquely define a binary tree.

However, this solution is very **memory intensive**.

### Solution 2

**The alternative solution** simply checks the tree similarity for each and every node.

Time complexity:

If k is the number of occurrences of T2â€™s root in T1, the worst case runtime can be characterized as O(n + k \* m).

**However, there can be a lot of pruning for this solution**, so it's NOT necessarily slower than Solution 1. There can be a lot of discussions on this (**refer to CC150v5 Q4.8 for more**).

### Code

**written by me**

    public static boolean containsTree(TreeNode t1, TreeNode t2) {
    	if (t1 == null) {
    		return false;
    	} else if (matchTree(t1, t2)) {
    		return true;
    	} else {
    		return containsTree(t1.left, t2) || containsTree(t1.right, t2);
    	}
    }

    private static boolean matchTree(TreeNode t1, TreeNode t2) {
    	if (t2 == null) {
    		return true;
    	} else if (t1 == null) {
    		return false;
    	} else if (t1.data != t2.data) {
    		return false;
    	} else {
    		return matchTree(t1.left, t2.left) && matchTree(t1.right, t2.right);
    	}
    }
