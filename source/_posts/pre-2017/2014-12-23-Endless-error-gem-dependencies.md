### The problem

In setting up the octopress environment, we need to install dependencies like this:

    gem install bundler
    bundle install

First line simply installs bundler (a Ruby dependency manager). The second line is where you might face problems:

> bundle install
>
> [Install the dependencies](http://bundler.io/man/bundle-install.1.html) specified in your Gemfile

Look at the Gemfile in your octopress folder, it looks like [this](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/blob/master/Gemfile):

    source "https://rubygems.org"

    group :development do
      gem 'rake', '~> 10.0'
      gem 'jekyll', '~> 2.0'
      gem 'octopress-hooks', '~> 2.2'
      gem 'octopress-date-format', '~> 2.0'
      gem 'jekyll-sitemap'
      gem 'rdiscount', '~> 2.0'
      gem 'RedCloth', '~> 4.2.9'
      gem 'haml', '~> 4.0'
      gem 'compass', '~> 1.0.1'
      gem 'sass-globbing', '~> 1.0.0'
      gem 'rubypants', '~> 0.2.0'
      gem 'rb-fsevent', '~> 0.9'
      gem 'stringex', '~> 1.4.0'
    end

    gem 'sinatra', '~> 1.4.2'

When I do 'bundle install':

    $ bundle install
    Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/........
    Resolving dependencies...

    Gem::RemoteFetcher::FetchError: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read
    server certificate B: certificate verify failed (https://rubygems.org/gems/rake-
    10.4.2.gem)
    An error occurred while installing rake (10.4.2), and Bundler cannot continue.
    Make sure that `gem install rake -v '10.4.2'` succeeds before bundling.

It shows the gem 'rake' is missing. So I did as I was instrcucted to. I type **gem install rake -v '10.4.2'** into command line, and execute. Again, I was told another gem missing. I kept doing this, until I found this is an endless procedure:

    $ bundle install
    Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/.......
    Using rake 10.3.2
    Using RedCloth 4.2.9
    Using blankslate 2.1.2.4

    Gem::RemoteFetcher::FetchError: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read
    server certificate B: certificate verify failed (https://rubygems.org/gems/timer
    s-1.1.0.gem)
    An error occurred while installing timers (1.1.0), and Bundler cannot continue.
    Make sure that `gem install timers -v '1.1.0'` succeeds before bundling.

Something is very wrong with the execution of 'bundle install'.

### The solution

Until I found [this post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15529451/octopress-installation-stops-during-bundle-install), I was hopelessly searching and learning Ruby gems and related things.

I fact, I just deleted 1 letter by changing **source "https://rubygems.org"** to **source "http://rubygems.org"** at line 1 of Gemfile in octopress folder.

Then, everything is fine:

    $ bundle install
    Fetching gem metadata from http://rubygems.org/........

I guess this is because my network security settings, but I do not know. If you are facing the same issue, I hope my solution helped. Or if you know the reason, please tell me by leaving a comment below. Thanks!
