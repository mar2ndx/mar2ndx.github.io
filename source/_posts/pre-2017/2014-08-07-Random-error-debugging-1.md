### Question

[link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4531742/debugging-a-program-that-crashes-10-times-in-different-places)

> You are given the source to an application which is crashing during run time. After running it 10 times in a debugger, you find it never crashes in the same place.

> What programming errors could be causing this crash? How would you test each one?

### Analysis

1. code depends on **system time or RNG**

1. disk full, i.e. other processes may delete a different file causing more space to be available

1. memory issue, i.e. other processes allocate and/or free memory

1. a pointer points to a random location in memory that is changed by another process causing some values be "valid" (very rare though)

[In general](http://stackoverflow.com/a/4531769) a situation **with other process** is likely.
