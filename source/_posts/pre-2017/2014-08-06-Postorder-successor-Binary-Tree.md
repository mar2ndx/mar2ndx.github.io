### Question

[link](http://www.careercup.com/question?id=5173972006076416)

> Write an algorithm to find the ‘next’ post-order successor of a given node in a binary tree and binary search tree.

> 1. where each node has a link to its parent.
> 1. without parent pointer

> Implement 2 versions of the algorithm: 1.) binary tree 2.) BST

### Solution

In postorder, any node below current node shall be 'predecessor' of current node. Thus we only care about current node's parent.

Suggested by a user:

    1) parent pointer is given.
    - go to the parent of the current node.
    - if current node is the right child of its parent => print parent.
    - else return leftmost node of the right sub-tree of parent.

    2) parent pointer is not given.
    - traverse the tree and find the parent of the current node
    - do the same as method (1).
