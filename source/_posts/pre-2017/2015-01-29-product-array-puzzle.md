> Given an array of integers , replace each element with the product of the remaining elements.

Eg : Input - 1 2 3 4  
 Output : 24 12 8 6

> Do not use division.

### Solution

Store the product of the left side elements for each integer, and also the right side.

For eg : L[]= {1 , 1 , 2 , 6 }

and R[] = { 24 , 12 , 4 , 1}

The multiply R[i] and L[i] to get the resultant array.
