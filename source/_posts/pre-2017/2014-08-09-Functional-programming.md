### Overview

**[A functional language](http://stackoverflow.com/a/23290) allows you to write a mathematical function**, i.e. a function that takes n arguments and returns a value. If the program is executed, this function is evaluated.

A purely functional program **always yields the same value for an input**, and the order of evaluation is not well-defined; which means that uncertain values like user input or random values are hard to model in purely functional languages.

### One Sentence

**Functional programming is like describing your [problem to a mathematician](http://stackoverflow.com/a/23475). Imperative programming is like giving instructions to an idiot**.

### Pros and Cons

Functional Programming allows coding [with fewer potentials for bugs](http://stackoverflow.com/a/24294) because each component is completely isolated. Also, using recursion and first-class functions allows for **simple proofs of correctness** which typically mirror the structure of the code.

Functional programming languages are typically [less efficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming#Efficiency_issues) in their use of CPU and memory than imperative languages such as C and Pascal.
