## Apply for Google AdSense

My first request of AdSense is rejected because of "**Site does not comply with Google policies**". I do not know the exact reason, but I did the following things to get it through:

1. I registered a top-level .COM domain name to replace the original github page's domain.

2. I added "Privacy Policy" page, and added the link to the bottom of each blog post.

3. I re-wrote the "About Me" page, and added in administrator email address.

4. I updated a few more posts, making it more than 580 posts in total.

5. I set up Google Webmaster Tools, and updated sitemap.xml in the configurations.

6. I resubmitted my request of AdSense again.

## Put AdSense in your blog

1.  Create a new file: source/\_includes/asides/advertise.html

2.  Copy and paste the code from AdSense, eg.

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <!-- ad-name -->
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
             ...............
        <script>
        (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>

3.  Go to **\_config.yml**, and look for "default_asides", then add "asides/advertise.html, " in the beginning of the array

        default_asides: [asides/advertise.html, asides/category_list.html, asides/recent_posts.html, asides/github.html, asides/delicious.html, asides/pinboard.html, asides/googleplus.html]

4.  Now you've added advertisement in your side menu.

5.  Go to **source/\_layouts/post.html** and look for:

        if site.disqus_short_name and page.comments

6.  Right **below the article**, and **above the comments**, add your AdSense code, again.

7.  Now you've added advertisement above your comment area.

Thanks for the effort from [this reference](https://www.hi29.net/post/2013/11/30/octopresszen-mo-fang-adsense/).

## Updates

Apr 9th update: my re-submission of Google AdSense is not approached, because of "not enough content". I don't know what else to do, so I switched to another ad platform.

Apr 11th update: For the first time ever, my blog has more than 1,000 visit per day.
