# Overview

This class covers database design:

1. design data with class and inheritance
1. design a user system (Netflix 2015)
1. design a payment system (Yelp, BigCommerce 2015)

# Question 1

**design account (login/out) system** for our radio app.

## Step one, scenario

1. register, update, remove account
1. login/out
1. user balance, VIP services

## Step Two, necessary

1. Ask

   1. total user: 100 million
   1. daily user: 1 million

1. predict

   1. daily active user in 3 month: 10 million
   1. register percentage: 1%
   1. daily new register: 100 thousand

1. more predict

   1. login percentage: 15%
   1. average login frequency: 1.2 (ppl may input wrong password 20% of time)
   1. daily login attempts: 10 million _ 15% _ 1.2 = 1.8 million
   1. average login frequency: 1.8 million / 24hr = 21 login/sec
   1. normal login frequency: 21 \* 2 = 42 login/sec
   1. peak login frequency: 42 \* 3 = 126 login/sec

## Step Three, Application

## Step Four, Kilobit

Data - User table should contain name and password. What else?

    class User {
        int userId; (primary key)
        String name;
        String password;
    }

Data - User Table

    class UserTable {
        list<User> table;

        public insert(){}
        public delete(User){}
        public update(User){}
        public User select(){}
    }

> **[CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)**, (Sometimes called SCRUD with an "S" for Search) are the four basic functions of persistent storage.

# Question 2

**verification and forbidden accounts**

We have to know the concept of **Account State Lifecycle Graph**:

![](/images/design-class2-account-life-cycle.png)

1. ban: fake user, advertising users... bannned by the management

1. inactive: user choose to suspend his own account, voluntarily.

1. delete account: normally we won't remove all related data (just make userId as "deleted"). Otherwise a lot of data can be violated. All your chatting history **actually remains**.

## redesign User Table

Old User table:

    class User {
        int userId; (primary key)
        String name;
        String password;
    }

Modified User table:

    class User {
        int userId;
        char name[10];
        char hiddenPassword[10];
        int state;
    }

1. We added state, to support Account life cycle.

1. We changed username to fixed size, for better performance on searching and storing. Can prevent certain attacks, too.

1. save encrypted password.

# Question 3

**design login/out process**

1. User account auto logged out after a certain period of time.
1. multiple account logged in at same time.

## Session

**Session is a conversation** between user and server.

1. User can have >1 session, if he log in from different devices.
1. Session must be verified, thus we have to keep **sessionId**.

Session status: "iPad online", "PC online"...

Modify User table:

    class User {
        int userId;
        char name[10];
        char hiddenPassword[10];
        int state;
        List<session> sessionList;
    }

Important in Session table:

1.  device ID
1.  time-out period

    class Session {
    private sessionId;
    int userId;

        int deviceCode;
        long timeOut;

    }

User table would include a **session list**.

## further improvement: session

1. we update sessionList very frequently.
1. size of sessionList is dynamic.

Solution: seperate the table.

Question: When to clean up the session data (considering huge amount of data and frequent calculation)?

> Answer: every end of day. Or store sessions in-memory, so it lose all the data when machine restarts (it is used in Gaming platforms). Or we can clean up one user's session list whenever the user did a new log-in.
>
> We do not remove session whenever it expires. It's too much calculation.

## further improvement: inheritance

Apply inheritance to UserTable and SessionTable:

    class Table {
        list<Row*> table;

        public insert(){}
        public delete(){}
        public update(){}
        public User select(){}
    }

    class UserTable extends Table {
    }

    class SessionTable extends Table {
    }

As for the Row class:

    class Row {
        List<Attributes> row;
    }

    class User extends Row {
    }

    class Session extends Row {
    }

# Question 4

**design search algorithm**

1. find my userId
1. find my userId range

Solution 1: add **HashMap** in the table. Can do search in O(1), but can't find range.

Solution 2: **BST data structure**. Can do search range and search in O(log2 n) time.

## Best solution: B+ tree

**[B+ tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree)** - everything in O(logb n) which is **close to constant time**.

Plus, B+ tree is hard disk friendly. Read more on a future post.
