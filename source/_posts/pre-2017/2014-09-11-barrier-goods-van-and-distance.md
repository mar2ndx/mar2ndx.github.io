> 2d array ＊代表障碍物 ＃代表货物 空白就是正常的路

> 问如何找到一个点为出发点 能实现总共取货路径最短？ 每次只能拿一个货物，遇到障碍需要绕开，拿到以后要放回出发点，然后再取另一个.

### Solution

This looks like a very difficult question, especially during a phone interview.

**The 10th floor gives the best solution**:

> **BFS from every box**. in each box, a non-blocking cell (include box position, but exclude hazard position) will have a weight value, stand for the distance to the box.

> after bfs from all the boxes, each cell will have k weight, k is the number of boxes. sum all the weight in each cell, and find the cell with smallest sum of weight.

> One problem of this solution may lead to a cell of a box. We can then sort the cell by sum of weight and find the first position that is not a box.

> complexity O(k\*n^2)

Suggested at [this post](http://www.mitbbs.com/article_t/JobHunting/32602449.html), we can also use **A\* search (with heuristic function)** to solve.
