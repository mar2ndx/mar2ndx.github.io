title: "[Octopress] Clone Octopress Blog From A Different Computer "

**Ruby/gem/bundler setup (on a new machine) has always been a hassle to me**. Not only that, I've had some confusions about developing Octopress blog on 2 different computers.

Now that I've had enough failures and success, I would like write a long post to summarize it.

### Install Ruby

Well first of all, we must install **Ruby** and **Development Kit**. Simply go this [this page](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) and download:

1. Ruby 1.9.3
1. DevKit for Ruby 1.9.3

**Installing Ruby** is straight-forward, only remember to check "Add Ruby to your PATH". Otherwise you need to manually set the **Ruby directory** (eg. C:\Ruby193\bin) in **System Variables Settings**.

**Ruby DevKit is a self-extracting archive**. After extracting the files, we should [initialize the DevKit](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/1-ruby-and-devkit/) like this:

    cd C:/RubyDevKit
    ruby dk.rb init
    ruby dk.rb install

### Clone octopress

**clone the source branch to the local octopress folder**

    using HTTPS
    git clone -b source https://github.com/okckd/okckd.github.io.git octopress

    or using SSH
    git clone -b source git@github.com:okckd/okckd.github.io.git octopress

I would recommend using SSH over HTTPS, because **using HTTPS, you will need to type your username and password everytime you push**.

To change from 'HTTPS' to 'SSH', follow [this instruction](http://stackoverflow.com/a/6565661):

    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git

More info about HTTPS and SSH is [available](https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use/).

### Install dependencies

Follow [this instruction](http://www.techelex.org/setup-octopress-windows7/) and install bundler and dependencies.

    cd c:/github/octopress
    gem install bundler
    rbenv rehash    # generally optional, unless you are using rbenv
    bundle install

If you see endless dependency errors here, please refer to my other post: **[[Ruby] Endless error with gem dependencies](/experience/2014-12-23-Endless-error-gem-dependencies)**.

If you are confused with some concepts in Ruby, read **[[Ruby] RubyGems, gem, Gemfile and Bundler](/experience/2014-12-22-RubyGems-gem-other)**.

### Now, start octopress

You can use either of the commands below to start octopress. I can't remember clearly but you can simply follow [this guide](http://octopress.org/docs/setup/).

    rake setup_github_pages

when prompted, enter this url: git@github.com:okckd/okckd.github.io.git

    rake install

### Commit your changes

You can do 'rake generate', then 'rake deploy' to deploy to master branch. If you see the "**Liquid Exception: Tag xxx was not properly terminated with regexp**": [do this](https://github.com/davidfstr/rdiscount/issues/75):

> The file that's causing this problem in octopress, is category_feed.xml, inside \_includes/custom. You need to replace "markdownify" for "markdownize" and it works. Now I can rest.

Do 'git commit", "git push origin source' to update blog source. [reference](http://blog.zerosharp.com/clone-your-octopress-to-blog-from-two-places/)

At this step, congratulations you are all set!

### Last word

Setting 'rake' up is found to be a great hassle for many, for example, [someone spent 7 hours on it](http://hamaluik.com/posts/switching-to-octopress/).

Wish this post can help!
