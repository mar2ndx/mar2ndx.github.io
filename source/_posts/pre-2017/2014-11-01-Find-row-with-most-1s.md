### Question

[link](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-row-with-maximum-number-1s/)

> Given a 2D array with only 1s and 0s, where each row is sorted.

> Find the row with the maximum number of 1s. Input matrix:

    0 1 1 1
    0 0 1 1
    1 1 1 1  // this row has maximum 1s
    0 0 0 0

> Output: 2

### Analysis

By using a modified version of binary search, we can achieve **[a O(mLogn) solution](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-row-with-maximum-number-1s/)** where m is number of rows and n is number of columns in matrix.

**However, there's better solution that works in linear time**!

### Solution

1. Get the index of first (or leftmost) 1 in the first row.

2. Do following for every row after the first row:

   1. IF the element on left of previous leftmost 1 is 0, ignore this row.

   1. ELSE Move left until a 0 is found. Update the leftmost index to this index and max_row_index to be the current row.

The time complexity is O(m+n).

### Code

**written by me**

    public int solution(int[][] matrix) {
    	int m = matrix.length;
    	int n = matrix[0].length;
    	int p = n;
    	int row = -1;
    	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    		// now p is larger than 0, otherwise it's already terminated
    		if (matrix[i][p - 1] == 0) {
    			continue;
    		}
    		// p points to a 1, now search to the left direction
    		for (int j = p - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
    			if (matrix[i][j] == 1) {
    				p = j;
    			} else {
    				break;
    			}
    		}
    		// p have a new value now
    		if (p == 0) {
    			return i;
    		} else {
    			row = i;
    		}
    	}
    	return row;
    }
