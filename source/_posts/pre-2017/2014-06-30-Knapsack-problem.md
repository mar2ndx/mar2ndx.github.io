### Question

[link](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-10-0-1-knapsack-problem/)

> Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value.

> In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum possible value.

> You cannot break an item, either pick it or don’t pick it (0-1 property).

### Analysis

This is a very similar question to **[Question] Coin Change Problem**, because directly using recursion to solve will result in a lot of re-calculations. It's a DP question.

### Solution

First of all, define a 2D array, Knapsack(n,W) denotes getting 'n'th item, with weight 'W'. When n == 0 or W = 0, dp value is 0.

> int[][] Knapsack = new int[n + 1][w + 1];

Using 'n' to denote the items to put into Knapsack. 'v' is the value and 'w' is the total weight.

Now if item 'n' is able to fit in:

> Knapsack(n,W) = max(vn + Knapsack(n-1, W-wn), Knapsack(n-1, W))

If not able to fit in:

> Knapsack(n,W) = Knapsack(n-1, W)

Refer to page 11 to 12 of [this pdf](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~zjb/courses/800/lec7.pdf).

### Follow up

Look at the code, we checked dp[i-1][j]. Now the question is:

> Do we need to check dp[i][j-1] ? (In case that total weight is not fully used up)

The answer is NO. We don't. Look at example: weights = {1, 2} and values = {3, 5}, and knapsack weight = 4. DP array would be:

    [
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 3, 3, 3, 3],
     [0, 3, 5, 8, 8]
    ]

See that? The way that we keep DP array size int[items + 1][totalweight + 1], the DP value is always 0 at 1st column and row.

So, in the example when i == 1, total value is ALWAYS 3.

### Code

    public int maxValNoDup(int totalWeight, int[] value, int[] weight) {
    	int items = value.length;
    	Arrays.sort(value);
    	Arrays.sort(weight);

    	int[][] dp = new int[items + 1][totalWeight + 1];
    	for (int i = 1; i <= items; i++) {
    		for (int j = 1; j <= totalWeight; j++) {
    			// we'll try to take i'th item, to fit in weight j
    			if (j < weight[i - 1]) {
    				// not able to put in
    				dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
    			} else {
    				// we are able to take i'th item into knapsack
    				dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], value[i - 1]
    						+ dp[i - 1][j - weight[i - 1]]);
    			}
    		}
    	}
    	return dp[items][totalWeight];
    }
