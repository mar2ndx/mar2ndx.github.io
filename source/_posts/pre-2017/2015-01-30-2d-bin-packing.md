### Question

[link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem)

> Objects of different volumes must be packed into a finite number of bins or containers each of volume V in a way that minimizes the number of bins used.

### Solution

Explanation from [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/8765049):

1. Build a binary tree. Each branch in the tree contains a sprite.
1. Each **leaf node represents available space**.
1. Initially the tree has just the root node, which represents all available space.
1. To add a sprite to the tree, search the tree for an unoccupied (leaf) node **big enough** to hold the sprite.
1. Turn that node from a leaf into a branch by setting the sprite as the node's occupant and giving the node two children.
1. One child represents the remaining space to the right of the sprite;
1. the other represents the remaining space below the sprite and the first child.

For detailed implementation and code, refer to [this](http://codeincomplete.com/posts/2011/5/7/bin_packing/) comprehensite guide. BTW, it's used for **auto generating CSS Sprites** which puts images into a large graph.
