### Question

> Design a Parking Lot.

### Solution

Class hierarchy:

1. A parking lot has multiple Levels.
1. A Level has multiple Parking Spot.
1. A Spot can park motorcycle, car or bus, which all belongs to Vehicle.

Implement methods:

1. Vehicle.parkInSpot(Spot s)
1. Vehicle.leaveSpot(Spot s)
1. Vehicle.canFitIn(Spot s)
1. ParkingLot.parkVehicle(Vehicle v)
1. Level.parkVehicle(Vehicle v)
1. Level.parkVehicleAtSpot(Vehicle v, Spot s)
1. Level.findAvailableSpot(VehicleType vt)

**ParkingLot Class is just a wrapper class of Levels**. By doing this, we seperated out parking logic from other broader actions (like Spot management).

The code below is from CC150v5. **Its design is a bit strange** (a car can occupy multiple spots), so just use this code as a guide but not a reference.

### Code

ParkingLot.java

    public class ParkingLot {
        private Level[] levels;
        private final int NUM_LEVELS = 5;

        public ParkingLot() {
            levels = new Level[NUM_LEVELS];
            for (int i = 0; i < NUM_LEVELS; i++) {
                levels[i] = new Level(i, 30);
            }
        }

        /* Park the vehicle in a spot (or multiple spots). Return false if failed. */
        public boolean parkVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
            for (int i = 0; i < levels.length; i++) {
                if (levels[i].parkVehicle(vehicle)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
            return false;
        }

        public void print() {
            for (int i = 0; i < levels.length; i++) {
                System.out.print("Level" + i + ": ");
                levels[i].print();
                System.out.println("");
            }
            System.out.println("");
        }
    }

Level.java

    /* Represents a level in a parking garage */
    public class Level {
        private int floor;
        private ParkingSpot[] spots;
        private int availableSpots = 0; // number of free spots
        private static final int SPOTS_PER_ROW = 10;

        public Level(int flr, int numberSpots) {
            floor = flr;
            spots = new ParkingSpot[numberSpots];
            int largeSpots = numberSpots / 4;
            int bikeSpots = numberSpots / 4;
            int compactSpots = numberSpots - largeSpots - bikeSpots;
            for (int i = 0; i < numberSpots; i++) {
                VehicleSize sz = VehicleSize.Motorcycle;
                if (i < largeSpots) {
                    sz = VehicleSize.Large;
                } else if (i < largeSpots + compactSpots) {
                    sz = VehicleSize.Compact;
                }
                int row = i / SPOTS_PER_ROW;
                spots[i] = new ParkingSpot(this, row, i, sz);
            }
