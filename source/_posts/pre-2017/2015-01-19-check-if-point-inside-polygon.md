### Solution

Prerequisite reading: **[Question] Check if two line segments intersect**.

Suggested by G4G, this is a simple idea to check:

1. Draw a horizontal line to the right of each point and extend it to infinity

1. Count the number of times the line intersects with polygon edges.

1. A point is inside the polygon if either count of intersections is odd or point lies on an edge of polygon.

1. Note the special case of point 'g'.
