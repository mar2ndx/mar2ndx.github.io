### Upcasting and Downcasting

Java permits an object of a **subclass type to be treated as an object of any superclass type**. This is [called upcasting](http://forum.codecall.net/topic/50451-upcasting-downcasting/). Upcasting is done automatically, while downcasting must be manually done.

[Example](http://forum.codecall.net/topic/50451-upcasting-downcasting/):

![](/images/java-upcasting-downcasting.jpg)

    Cat c1 = new Cat();
    Animal a = c1; //automatic upcasting to Animal
    Cat c2 = (Cat) a; //manual downcasting back to a Cat

Upcasting is always typesafe but can cause the so called ["slicing" problem](http://forums.codeguru.com/showthread.php?321676-What-are-upcasting-and-downcasting-dangers).

### Object Slicing

[Object slicing](https://www.java.net/also-in-java/object-slicing-and-component-design-java) is defined as the conversion of an object into something with less information (typically a superclass)

### More detail

If you upcast an object, it will **lose all it's properties**, which were inherited. For example, if you cast a Cat to an Animal, it will lose properties inherited from Mammal and Cat. Note, that **data will not be lost, you just can't use it**, until you downcast the object to the right level.

### Example

    class Base {
    	void doSomething() {
    		System.out.println("Base");
    	}
    }

    class Derived extends Base {
    	void doSomething() {
    		System.out.println("Derived");
    	}
    }

    public class JavaUpcasting {
    	public static void main(String[] args) {
    		Base instance = new Derived();
    		instance.doSomething();
    	}
    }

This will output "Derived".
