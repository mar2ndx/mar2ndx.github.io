### Overview

strStr() is a classic question in CS. There are various ways to solve (which we have discussed before), this is a summarization:

1. naive - O(m \* n)

1. [KMP](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/searching-for-patterns-set-2-kmp-algorithm/) - O(n) in worst case

1. [Rabin-Karp](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/searching-for-patterns-set-3-rabin-karp-algorithm/), rolling hash - between O(m \* n) and O(m + n)

   Matches the hash value of the pattern with the hash value of pattern. If the hash values match, then only it starts matching individual characters.

1. [Modified naive algo](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pattern-searching-set-4-a-naive-string-matching-algo-question/), only work if pattern contains no duplicate characters.

   Only match the first char. This case is quite boring, can skip.

1. Suffix tree

   Will discuss in details.
