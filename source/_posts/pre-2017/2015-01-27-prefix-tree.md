### Prefix tree

1. Building a well balanced BST needs time proportional to M \* log N, where M is maximum string length and N is number of keys in tree.
1. Using trie, search in O(M) time.
1. The penalty is on trie storage requirements.

### Implementation

1. Every node of trie consists of multiple branches.
1. Each branch represents a possible character of keys.
1. Mark the last node of every key as leaf node.

   struct trie_node
   {
   int value; /_ Used to mark leaf nodes _/
   trie_node_t \*children[ALPHABET_SIZE];
   };

Note that a **non-terminating node can also be marked as leaf**. Eg.

                       root
                    /   \    \
                    t  'a'    b
                    |   |     |
                    h   n    'y'
                    |   |  \    \
                   'e'  s  'y'  'e'
                 /  |   |
                i   r   w
               /    |   |
             'r'   'e'  e
                        |
                       'r'

The leaf nodes are quoted in ''.

Insert and search costs **O(key_length)**, however the memory requirements of trie is **O(ALPHABET_SIZE _ key_length _ N)** where N is number of keys in trie.

**Compressed trie**, ternary search tree, etc. can be used to minimize memory requirements of trie.
