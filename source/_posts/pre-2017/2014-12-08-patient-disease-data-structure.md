### Question

[link](http://www.mitbbs.com/article_t0/JobHunting/32844253.html)

> Suppose N patients and M diseases. N is sufficiently large number and M is
> relatively small, say 30-ish. Each patient can have possible 0 to M kinds of
> diseases.

> Given one patientâ€™s name, show me a list of similar patients sharing same
> deseases within 2-3 seconds.

### Solution

**Use 1 bit to represent a disease**. So every patient's conditin can be put into an integer of 32 bits.

How do we calculate the similarity of 2 patients?

Refer to **[CC150v5] 5.5 Calculate Bits Conversion Required** for a special bit operation (remove last '1' from bit):

> c = c & (c - l) clears the least significant bit of '1'.
>
> Keep doing this until all '1's are cleared.

For each patient, we simply calculate the XOR and count '1's.

### Code

no code.
