# Overview

## 3 areas of cryptographic standard:

1. encryption standard

   1. Data Encryption Standard (obsolete)
   1. Triple DES
   1. **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**
   1. **RSA**
   1. OpenPGP
   1. CipherSaber

1. hash standard

   1. **MD5**
   1. **SHA-1**
   1. SHA-2
   1. HMAC
   1. PBKDF2

1. digital signature standard

   1. Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
   1. RSA
   1. Elliptic

## Symmetric-key algorithm

[Use the same cryptographic keys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm) for both encryption and decryption.

The keys represent a shared secret between two parties, and maintain a private information link.

This requirement that both parties have access to the secret key is one of the main drawbacks.

## Public-key cryptography

The public key is used:

1. encrypt plaintext
1. verify a digital signature

private key is used:

1. decrypt ciphertext
1. create a digital signature.

# Encryption standard

## RSA Vs. AES

**RSA is very computationally expensive** by comparison with AES. It involves mathematics with very large numbers, whilst AES can be implemented with relatively simple bit operations.

[RSA is a public-key encryption algorithm](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/10949/encryption-should-i-be-using-rsa-or-aes) (asymmetric), while AES is a symmetric key algorithm. Often a cryptosystem will use both algorithms.

[A good compromise is to](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13238674/aes-vs-rsa-to-encrypt-large-size-of-data) use RSA to encrypt the symmetric key that is then used in AES encryption of the larger data.

uses RSA encryption.

# hash standard

## MD5

The MD5 message-digest algorithm is a widely used cryptographic hash function producing a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value, or 32 digit Hex.

## SHA-1

SHA-1 produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value, or 40 digit Hex.

# digital signature standard

A valid digital signature gives a recipient confidence that the message was created by a known sender.

commonly used for software distribution, financial transactions

[To create a digital signature](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/digital-signature), signing software (such as an email program) creates a one-way hash of the data to be signed. The private key is then used to encrypt the hash.

> The reason for encrypting the hash instead of entire message is that a hash function can convert an arbitrary input into a fixed length value, which is usually much shorter.

Other party validate the integrity of the data by using the signer's public key to decrypt the hash.

> Note: you can choose to '** Add digital signature to this message **' in Microsoft Office.
