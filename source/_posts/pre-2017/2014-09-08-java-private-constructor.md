### Question

> In terms of inheritance, what is the effect of keeping a constructor private?

### Solution

[If the programmer](http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=40) does not provide a constructor for a class, **the system will always provide a default, public no-argument constructor**.

To disable this default constructor, simply add a private no-argument constructor to the class.

Two categories of usage:

1. Object construction is entirely forbidden
   1. class offers only static members (sometimes called **[utility class](http://stackoverflow.com/a/17342889)**)
1. Object construction is private only
   1. a class needs to prevent the caller from creating objects, like Singleton
