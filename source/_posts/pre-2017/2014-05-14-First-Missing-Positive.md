### Question

[link](http://oj.leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/)

<div class="question-content">
            <p></p><p>
Given an unsorted integer array, find the first missing positive integer.
</p>

<p>
For example,<br>
Given <code>[1,2,0]</code> return <code>3</code>,<br>
and <code>[3,4,-1,1]</code> return <code>2</code>.
</p>

<p>
Your algorithm should run in <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>) time and uses constant space.
</p><p></p>
          </div>

### Analysis

**This is a very difficult question**!

The tricky part of this question is the limit in space/time. If we sort and check, the space is constent, but time is increased.

The key is to **make use of the position index of the array**.

### Solution

**Make sure that (i)th item of the array stores value (i+1)**. The image below and the quoted text from [this blog](http://tianrunhe.wordpress.com/2012/07/15/finding-the-1st-missing-positive-int-in-an-array-first-missing-positive/) are very good explanations.

> The idea is simple. What is the most desired array we want to see? Something like \[1,2,3\] then we know 4 is missing, or \[1, 8, 3, 4\] then we know 2 is missing. In other word, “all the numbers are in their correct positions”.
>
> What are correct positions? For any i, A\[i\] = i+1. So our goal is to rearrange those numbers (in place) to their correct positions.
>
> We then need to decide how to arrange them. Let’s take the \[3, 4, -1, 1\] as an example. The 1st number, 3, we know it should stay in position 2. So we swap A\[0\] = 3 with A\[2\]. We then get \[-1, 4, 3, 1\]. We can’t do anything about -1 so we leave it there. The 2nd number, 4, we know it should sit in A\[3\]. So we swap A\[1\] = 4 with A\[3\]. We then get \[-1, 1, 3, 4\]. Now 1 should stay in A\[0\], so we keep swapping and we get \[1, -1, 3, 4\]. Notice now every positive number is staying in their correct position (A\[0\]=1, A\[2\]=3 and A\[3\]=4). We then need one more scan to find out 2 is missing.

### My code

    public class Solution {
        public int firstMissingPositive(int[] A) {
            if (A == null || A.length == 0) {
                return 1;
            }
            int len = A.length;
            int p = 0;
            while (p < len) {
                if (A[p] == p + 1) {
                    // the number is in its correct position~
                    p++;
                    continue;
                } else if (A[p] <= 0 || A[p] > len) {
                    // the number is out of range, leave it alone then.
                    p++;
                    continue;
                } else if (A[p] == A[A[p] - 1]) {
                    // this is an important case!!! I missed it just now~
                    p++;
                    continue;
                }
                swop(A, p, A[p] - 1);
            }
            // now check and find the first number that is not in correct position
            p = 0;
            while (p < len) {
                if (A[p] != p + 1) {
                    return p + 1;
                }
                p++;
            }
            return p + 1;
        }

        private void swop(int[] A, int x, int y) {
            int temp = A[x];
            A[x] = A[y];
            A[y] = temp;
        }
    }
