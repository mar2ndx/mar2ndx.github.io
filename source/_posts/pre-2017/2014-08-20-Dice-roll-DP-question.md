### Question

[link](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dice-throw-problem/)

> Given n dice each with m faces, numbered from 1 to m, find the number of ways to get sum X. X is the summation of values on each face when all the dice are thrown.

### Solution

**DP**

> Sum(m, n, X) = Sum(m, n - 1, X - 1) +
>
>                Sum(m, n - 1, X - 2) +
>
>                .................... +
>
>                Sum(m, n - 1, X - m)

So we can have dp(n)(X) and for each, iterate m time. Total time is O(m _ n _ X).

### Code

**not written by me**.

    int findWays(int m, int n, int x)
    {
        // Create a table to store results of subproblems.  One extra
        // row and column are used for simpilicity (Number of dice
        // is directly used as row index and sum is directly used
        // as column index).  The entries in 0th row and 0th column
        // are never used.
        int table[n + 1][x + 1];
        memset(table, 0, sizeof(table)); // Initialize all entries as 0

        // Table entries for only one dice
        for (int j = 1; j <= m && j <= x; j++)
            table[1][j] = 1;

        // Fill rest of the entries in table using recursive relation
        // i: number of dice, j: sum
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
            for (int j = 1; j <= x; j++)
                for (int k = 1; k <= m && k < j; k++)
                    table[i][j] += table[i-1][j-k];

        /* Uncomment these lines to see content of table
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)
        {
          for (int j = 0; j <= x; j++)
            cout << table[i][j] << " ";
          cout << endl;
        } */
        return table[n][x];
    }
