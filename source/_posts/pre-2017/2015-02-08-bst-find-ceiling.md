### Question

[link](http://www.careercup.com/question?id=20229674)

> A binary search tree is given. Find the ceiling of given key. Eg.

                        8
                   3          12
               2      6    10    15
                    4

> Ceiling is [defined](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/floor-and-ceil-from-a-bst/) as:

> Ceil Value Node: Node with smallest data larger than the key value.

> Testing:

    key - 13 => 15
    key - 4 =>6
    key - 8 =>10

### Solution

**A really interesting idea** is to go top-to-bottom, and update value in every **left turn only**. Suggested by the [top answer](http://www.careercup.com/question?id=20229674).

It's a very very tricky solution. I've never seen this b4.

### Code

Not my code.

    public int findCeil(TreeNode node, int num, int found) {
    	if (node != null) {
    		if (num >= node.val)
    			return findCeil(node.right, num, found);
    		else
    			return findCeil(node.left, num, node.val);
    	} else
    		return found;
    }

Now input:

> TreeNode tree = Common.constructBstFromPreorder(new int[] { 40, 20, 10, 30, 60, 50, 70 });

Output:

    The ceiling of 0 is  10
