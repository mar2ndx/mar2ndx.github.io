### Question

[link](http://oj.leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)

<div class="question-content">
            <p></p><p>A robot is located at the top-left corner of a <i>m</i> x <i>n</i> grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).</p>

<p>The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).</p>

<p>How many possible unique paths are there?</p>

### Solution

**This is an easy question**.

Basically to walk from (0,0) to (m,n), robot have to walk down (m-1) steps and rightward (n-1) steps. Then this problem simply becomes [Number of k-combinations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination#Number_of_k-combinations) (also known as choose m from n problem). The code is just concise and short.

### My code

    public class Solution {
        public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
            m--;
            n--;
            if (m < 0 || n < 0) {
                return 0;
            } else if (m == 0 || n == 0) {
                return 1;
            }
            long sum = 1;
            // the answer would be "choose m from (m + n)"
            if (m > n) {
                int temp = m;
                m = n;
                n = temp;
            }
            int num = m + n;
            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
                sum *= (num - i);
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
                sum /= (i + 1);
            }
            return (int) sum;
        }
    }
