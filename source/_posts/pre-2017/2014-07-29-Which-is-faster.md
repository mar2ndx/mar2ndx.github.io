### Question

[link](http://tech-queries.blogspot.sg/2010/09/which-loop-is-faster.html)

> A very basic programming puzzle is being asked in programming interviews since last few years. Which of the below two loops will run faster?

    /* First */
    for(i=0;i<100;i++)
     for(j=0;j<10;j++)
         //do somthing

    /* Second */
    for(i=0;i<10;i++)
     for(j=0;j<100;j++)
         //do somthing

### Solution

1. The First executes assignment operations 101 times, while Second executes only 11 times.
1. The First does 101 + 1100 = 1201 comparisons, while the Second does 11 + 1010 = 1021 comparisons.
1. The First executes 1100 increments, while the Second executes 1010 increments.

### Code

The following code proves why First is faster.

    public static void solution() {
    	int i, j, k, l;
    	k = 0;
    	l = 0;
    	/* FIRST */
    	for (i = 0, l++; i < 10; i++, k++)
    		for (j = 0, l++; j < 100; j++, k++)
    			;
    	// printf("First Loop: %d\t%d\n", k, l);
    	System.out.println(k);
    	System.out.println(l);

    	k = 0;
    	l = 0;
    	/* SECOND */
    	for (i = 0, l++; i < 100; i++, k++)
    		for (j = 0, l++; j < 10; j++, k++)
    			;
    	// printf("Second Loop: %d\t%d\n", k, l);
    	System.out.println(k);
    	System.out.println(l);
    }

output is : 1010, 11, 1100, 101
