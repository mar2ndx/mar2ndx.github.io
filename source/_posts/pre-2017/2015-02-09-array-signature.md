### Question

[link](http://www.careercup.com/question?id=14912744)

> You are given an array of n elements [1,2,....n]. For example {3 2 1 4 6 5 7}.

> Now we create a signature of this array by comparing every consecutive pair of elements. If they increase, write "I" else write "D".

> For example for the above array, the signature would be "DDIIDI". The signature thus has a length of N-1.

> Now given a signature, compute the lexicographically **smallest permutation** of [1,2,....n].

### Solution

A great [answer](http://qr.ae/BPfNw):

> Take the above case. Signature = DDIIDI.

> Take original permutation as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.

> Then for first continuous sequence DD reverse the strip 1 2 3 to 3 2 1 hence sequence becomes 3 2 1 4 5 6 7.

> Then for second sequence D reverse strip 5 6 to 6 5 hence sequence becomes 3 2 1 4 6 5 7.

> There is no continuous D left we are done and reached the answer.

### Code

Not written.
