# Overview

Today we'll look at 6 examples of problems associated with Web Service:

1. how the internet works
1. DNS
1. Web server
1. Music Player
1. MP3 file
1. 秒杀

# Question 0

**how to solve raido-play failures**

    > Failure rate  = % user who can't listen to music properly

    > = # user who fail to plya one song / # total users

Misson: reduce failure rate.

## How does server identify a user?

![](/images/design-class3-http-request-overview.png)

> If a server uses **Cookie** to identify unique users, the result might be > real users.

> However, if server uses **IP address**, the result might be < real users.

## How to collect data for failure rate

### Version 1

Log:

1. user send a log to server when it visits
1. user send another log after it plays a song
1. we can identify users who failed to play a song

![](/images/design-class3-server-failure-rate-1.png)

> In fact, everything should be logged, including play, pause, switch song, refresh etc.

### Version 2

User login are, in fact, **automatically logged** when user visits. Thus user ONLY have to send log **after it plays music**.

## Summary

1. define failure rate
1. user cookie to identify user
1. use log to collect failure data
1. analysis pattern of failure againt date/time

# Question 1

**the process of playing music**

![](/images/design-class3-web-browser-17-steps.png)

1. Prepare
2. Send DNS request
3. Prepare DNS reply
4. Send DNS reply
5. Process DNS reply

   -

6. Send webpage request
7. Prepare webpage reply
8. Send webpage reply
9. Process webpage

   -

10. Request music player
11. Prepare music player
12. Send music player
13. Process music player

    -

14. Request MP3
15. Prepare MP3
16. Send MP3
17. Play MP3

What is process Music Play?

> Local browser will do rendering, flash decoding etc. If any point of this 17 steps went wrong, the music-play fails.

Is there a system/browser default Music Play?

> HTML player is, but flash player is not. So the flash module have to be requested every time.

## Real data: failure rate 20%

In practise, the real failure rate is 20%. Which is:

1. 8% DNS
1. 5% Web
1. 5% MP3
1. 2% Player

# Question 2

**fix DNS problem**

First of all, how to find out DNS failures? There are 2 ways. First way, help desk do it. Second way is to use the Desktop app to help detect the host address.

## Step 1. HOSTs hijack

Some users' host file can modified by competitors.

1. ping the website url
1. modify host file manually or by desktop app

## Step 2. ISP

Each ISP have different DNS service. Eg. CSTNET fails to update the latest DNS, after a server change.

After this step, DNS failure rate fall from 8% to 1%. Why still 1%? Some companies bans music play in company web.

# Question 3

**fix the web problem**

Highest failure rate:

1. 3pm office hour
1. 9pm highest bandwidth nation-wide

## Solution 1, reverse proxy

Reverse proxy w/ more servers. Reverse proxy acts like a load balancer.

![](/images/design-class3-reverse-proxly.png)

> **[Reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy)** is a type of proxy server that retrieves resources on behalf of a client from one or more servers. These resources are then returned to the client as though they originated from the proxy server itself.

[Common uses for a reverse proxy server](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/) include:

> 1. Load balancing

> act as a “traffic cop,” sitting in front of your back-end servers and client requests. Try to **maximizes speed and capacity utilization** while ensuring **no one server is overloaded**.

> If a server goes down, the load balancer redirects traffic to the remaining online servers.

> 1. Web acceleration

>     can compress inbound and outbound data, as well as __cache commonly requested content__

>     also perform additional tasks such as SSL encryption to take __load off of your web servers__

> 1. Security and anonymity

>     By intercepting requests headed for your back-end servers, a reverse proxy server protects their identities and acts as an additional defense against security attacks.

## Solution 2, reduce size of web page

1. simplify javascript files
1. compress images (lower dpi)
1. merge large images to 1 image (less requests)
1. lazy loading (Pinterest uses it a lot)

## Solution 3, more cacheable pages

**Change dynamic webpages to static pages**. The advantage of this is:

1. more search engine friendly.
1. more cache friendly.

### Summary on caching

Caching can happen at place Number 1, 2 and 3:

![](/images/design-class3-web-hosting-4-layers.png)

AT Number 4, we can add **more servers**. Number 3, **reverse proxy**. Number 2 is **caching within the ISP network**, which avoids requesting info again from backend. Number 1 is **front-end browser cache**.

After this step, Web failure rate fall from 7% to 4%. Why still 4%? Well, these failure is mainly from the junk users created by marketing.
