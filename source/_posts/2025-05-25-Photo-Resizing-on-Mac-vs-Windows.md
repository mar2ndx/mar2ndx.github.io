Last week, I found myself with a massive photo resizing job – over 12,000 images that needed to be processed for a client project. Since I have both a Mac and Windows machine on my desk, I thought: why not run a proper benchmark and settle this debate once and for all?

## My Test Setup

**Mac Setup:**
- 2.3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 
- macOS with ImageMagick (command line)
- Using these commands:
```bash
# For 800px poster size
SIZE=800
mkdir $SIZE && for f in *.jpg; do convert "$f" -resize ${SIZE}x "$SIZE/$f"; done

# For 1024px backdrop size  
SIZE=1024
FOLDER_NAME=$(basename "$PWD")
mkdir "../${FOLDER_NAME}_w$SIZE" && for f in *.jpg; do magick "$f" -resize ${SIZE}x "../${FOLDER_NAME}_w$SIZE/$f"; done
```

**Windows Setup:**
- Intel i7-8700 (6-core)
- Windows 10 with Fotosizer software
- Standard GUI batch processing

## The Numbers Don't Lie

### First Run Results
- **Files processed:** 12,278 images
- **Windows:** 1.58GB processed in **56 minutes**
- **Mac:** 1.86GB processed in **37 minutes**
- **Winner:** Mac by 19 minutes (34% faster!)

### Second Run (Smaller Files)
- **Files processed:** 12,265 images  
- **Windows:** 932MB processed in **~51 minutes** (estimated)
- **Mac:** 1.16GB processed in **~33 minutes** (estimated)

The Mac consistently crushed it, even when processing smaller file sizes.

## Breaking Down the Performance

**Processing Speed:**
- Mac: ~332 files per minute
- Windows: ~219 files per minute

**Data Throughput:**
- Mac: ~50MB per minute (first run)
- Windows: ~28MB per minute (first run)

The 8-core i9 clearly flexes its muscle here. But it's not just raw CPU power – ImageMagick is incredibly optimized for this kind of work.

## What I Actually Experienced

**On Mac:** 
I literally just typed the command, hit enter, and went to grab coffee. Came back 37 minutes later to perfectly resized images in organized folders. The terminal showed a steady stream of processed files flying by.

**On Windows:**
Fotosizer's GUI is definitely prettier. I could see thumbnails, adjust quality settings with sliders, and watch a progress bar. But man, it was slow. The interface occasionally froze for a few seconds when processing large batches, and I had to babysit it more.

## The Real Talk

**Mac Command Line Pros:**
- Blazing fast (34% faster in my tests)
- Zero GUI overhead 
- Easy to script and repeat
- Handles massive batches without breaking a sweat
- Free (ImageMagick is open source)

**Mac Command Line Cons:**
- You need to learn terminal commands
- No visual preview of settings
- Easy to mess up file paths if you're not careful

**Windows Fotosizer Pros:**  
- Point-and-click simplicity
- Visual feedback and previews
- Harder to accidentally delete files
- Works great for smaller batches

**Windows Fotosizer Cons:**
- Significantly slower on large batches
- GUI can become unresponsive
- Costs money for the full version
- Limited automation options

## File Size Observations

Interesting detail: the Mac versions consistently produced slightly larger file sizes (1.86GB vs 1.58GB, 1.16GB vs 932MB). This suggests ImageMagick's default compression might preserve more image quality, though I didn't do a pixel-peeping comparison.

## My Bottom Line

If you're doing this once in a blue moon with a few hundred photos, Fotosizer on Windows is perfectly fine. The GUI makes it approachable, and the time difference won't matter much.

But if you're regularly processing thousands of images – whether you're a photographer, run an e-commerce site, or manage digital assets – the Mac + ImageMagick combo is a no-brainer. That 19-minute time savings adds up fast when you're doing this weekly.

The learning curve for command line tools is real, but honestly? These two commands cover 90% of batch resizing needs. Copy, paste, modify the size number, done.

For my workflow, the Mac setup wins hands down. Your mileage may vary, but the numbers speak for themselves: 12,278 files don't lie.
